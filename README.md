# 🎴👩🏻‍💻 **Moroccan Card Game - Ronda 🎮**

**Developed with C++ and Qt**

## Tools Used
🖥️ 📚👩🏾‍💻✅
- **Qt Creator:** Used as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for its native compatibility with Qt, facilitating the visual design of user interfaces and debugging.
- **QMake and CMake:** QMake was used for managing the Qt project specifically, while CMake was adopted for its ability to efficiently handle dependencies and configure the project build process in a more general context.
- **Main Library:** The main library used is the Qt library, which offers a comprehensive set of features for C++ application development.

## Project Objective
📲🤖🎮
The project aims to develop a Moroccan card game based on the popular "Ronda" game. Moroccan cards, consisting of 40 cards distributed in four suits (cups, swords, clubs, and coins), serve as the foundation for playing this game. The primary objective of the game is to score a certain number of points by collecting specific cards.

## How to Run the Project
🤖🧠🧑‍💻🖥️⚙️🦾
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have Qt installed on your machine.
   - Set up your development environment.

**To install Qt Creator on **Windows** for game development with Qt and C++, follow these steps:
-> Download and run the Qt installer from the official Qt download site:
- https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html
- https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-windows
**To install Qt Creator on **LINUX**:
  - https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/resources/qt/install-linux

-> During installation, select the "Qt 6.5 for desktop development," the MinGW toolchain, and Qt libraries for MinGW.
-> Wait for the installation process to complete.
-> Launch Qt Creator and configure build kits by going to Tools > Options > Build & Run > Kits. Ensure a compiler is selected.

**🎴 🎮 Embarking on game programming for the first time was an amazing opportunity. It allowed me to explore uncharted territories, tackle challenges, and experience the thrill of creating something unique with code. Cheers to diving into the world of game development and all the exciting possibilities it brings! 🚀✨**

**Moreover, having the chance to control the timing of player actions and animations, understanding the nuances between the start and end of each action, added an extra layer of excitement to the project. It's a fantastic feeling to not only build a game but also to have control over the intricate details that bring it to life. 🎮⏰**
